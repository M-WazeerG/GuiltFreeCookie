      <p>
        Cookies are small files a website saves in your browser. "Local storage" and "session storage" do a
        similar job: they let a website remember something between pages or visits, such as whether you're
        signed in. This policy covers all of them.

        our product list live in the page address, not in cookies.

      <p>
        Because this is strictly necessary for a service our staff ask for (signing in), it doesn't need
        separate consent, which is why you won't see a cookie banner on our site.

    <LegalSection id="other-sites" :number="4" title="Other websites">
      <p>
        Some links take you to other websites, such as Google Maps for our address or our social media
        pages. Those sites may set their own cookies, which are covered by their own policies, not this one.

      <p>
        You can see and delete cookies and stored site data in your browser's settings, usually under
        "Privacy" or "Site data". Clearing it won't affect shopping on our site; for staff, it simply signs
        them out of the admin dashboard.

        If we start using anything new, such as saving your cart between visits or adding analytics, we'll
        update this page first and ask for your consent wherever it's needed.
